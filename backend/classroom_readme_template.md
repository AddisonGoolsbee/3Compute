# Classroom: {{CLASSROOM_NAME}}

Access Code: `{{ACCESS_CODE}}`

## What is a 3Compute Classroom?

A classroom groups a set of participants (students) with one or more instructors and provides a shared logical space inside the coding environment. For each classroom you own:

- A host directory is mounted inside your container at `/classrooms/{{CLASSROOM_ID}}`.
- A `templates/` folder lets you place starter files or reference material you want participants to copy.
- A `participants/` folder is allows for shared artifacts and per‑participant views or edits.

## Sharing Templates

As an instructor, you can easily share project templates with your classroom:

**For students:** When you join this classroom, you'll see a `classroom-templates/` folder inside your classroom directory. This folder contains all the templates shared by your instructor. You can copy files from there to your workspace to start working on them.

You can give the access code above to participants so they can join this classroom. Keep it private—anyone with the code can request access (additional approval / flows may be added later).

If this README becomes outdated you can safely delete it; it will be regenerated next time your server restarts.
