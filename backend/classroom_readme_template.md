# Classroom: {{CLASSROOM_NAME}}

Access Code: `{{ACCESS_CODE}}`

## What is a 3Compute Classroom?
A classroom groups a set of participants (students) with one or more instructors and provides a shared logical space inside the coding environment. For each classroom you own:

- A host directory is mounted read-only inside your container at `/classrooms/{{CLASSROOM_ID}}`.
- A `templates/` folder lets you place starter files or reference material you want participants to copy.
- A `participants/` folder is reserved for future per‑participant views or shared artifacts (currently read-only inside your container to help prevent accidental edits).

You can give the access code above to participants so they can join this classroom. Keep it private—anyone with the code can request access (additional approval / flows may be added later).

If this README becomes outdated you can safely delete it; it will be regenerated next time your server restarts.
